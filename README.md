# Browser Developer Tools
In this assignment, you will use your browser (any browser) developer tools to change the content of some pages on the Internet. You need to take a screenshot of the page you changed and include it in this repo, along with the changed code. For example, I changed a header of an article on NYTimes. Here's what I would submit:

### The screenshot:
![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674072472/ENSF-381/labs/changed-header.png)

### The code I changed:
```html
<div class="css-1sojcmr ehdk2mb0">
   <h1 id="link-41efc3e8" class="css-1xo8ouk e1h9rw200" data-testid="headline">I Changed This Header!</h1>
</div>
```

:warning: The code you change may not be formatted. As that would be hard to read for grading, use a formatting tool before submitting (such as [`codebeautifier`](https://codebeautify.org/)). You can also install a VSCode extension for that.
